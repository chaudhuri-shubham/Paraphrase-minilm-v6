Perfect — here’s how you can answer those three questions clearly and confidently, in a way IT or management will understand (mix of technical and practical reasoning 👇):

1️⃣ Password-Protected Files

Answer:
Yes, filtering out password-protected files is relatively easy.

Most libraries (like PyPDF2 for PDFs or python-docx for Word files) raise a clear error or flag (is_encrypted=True) when a file is password-protected.

We can simply check that flag or handle the exception before processing, and skip such files.

So this is a low-effort update, requiring just a few lines of code and a log entry for skipped files.


✅ In short: Easy to implement — just detect and skip.

2️⃣ Attachments in Email Files (MSG)

Answer:
This is also not difficult to handle.

When parsing emails with extract_msg (or similar library), attachments can be easily detected through the attribute msg.attachments.

We can check len(msg.attachments) — if it’s greater than 0, mark that email as having attachments.

Optionally, we can process the attachments if they are text-based (like .pdf or .docx), or simply log their presence.


✅ In short: Straightforward to identify and handle — can be implemented quickly.

3️⃣ Files That Contain Only Images (No Text Content)

Answer:
This one is a bit trickier but doable with the right approach.

After trying to extract text, if the output text length is extremely short (say <10 characters), we can check if the file contains images.

For PDFs: using fitz (PyMuPDF), we can check page.get_images() — if there are images but no text, it’s image-only.

For DOCX: check if there are no paragraphs but there are inline images (len(doc.inline_shapes) > 0).

For emails: if the body text is empty but only image attachments exist, it can be flagged similarly.


⚙️ Complexity: Medium — needs an additional check after text extraction, but still manageable.

✅ In short: Possible with an extra layer of logic; slightly more work than the other two but not complex.

Summary

Case	Difficulty	Approach Summary

Password-Protected	🟢 Easy	Detect encryption flag or open error → skip
Email Attachments	🟢 Easy	Check number of attachments → log / handle
Image-Only Files	🟡 Moderate	Check text length + presence of images
